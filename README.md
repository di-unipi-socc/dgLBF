If you want to try our declarative tool, you can run one of the available [versions](/versions), which are explained in detail in the abovementioned paper, by using a [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org) engine.

You can also run our [Python script](/sim/main.py), which generates a knowledge base for the infrastructure to use in your experiments.
